Based on the available knowledge base, I cannot find any information about constitutional articles or their content. The knowledge base does not appear to contain documents related to constitutions or their specific provisions.

fix the contextual retrieval project main.py according to agentic-rag project main.py. Add similar logging and fix the response parsing

---

### 🤖 Cursor Assistant

I'll help you fix the contextual retrieval project's main.py by adding similar logging and response parsing as the agentic-rag project. Let me first examine both files to understand the differences.

---

### 🤖 Cursor Assistant

I'll now fix the contextual retrieval project's main.py and agent.py to add better logging and response handling similar to the agentic-rag project.

---

### 👤 You

You MUST write document_store.json whenever any chunk is indexed. Do not update it in batch

---

### 🤖 Cursor Assistant

I'll fix the indexing script to ensure document_store.json is written immediately after each chunk is indexed, not in batch. Let me examine and update the indexing logic.

top k should be 3.
In addition, fix the parsing of results

---

### 🤖 Cursor Assistant

I see the issue. The retrieval pipeline is returning results, but our code is not parsing them correctly. Let me fix the response parsing and set top_k to 3.

---

### 👤 You

Fix the README of this project. There is no non-contextual path.

---

### 🤖 Cursor Assistant

I'll fix the README for the contextual retrieval project to accurately document the system and its improvements.

---

### 🤖 Cursor Assistant

I'll fix the README to accurately reflect the contextual retrieval project's functionality. Let me review and update it.

---

### 🤖 Cursor Assistant

I've successfully updated the README to accurately reflect how the contextual retrieval system works. The key changes include:

## Main Corrections:

1. **Architecture** - Updated to show context generation as an optional step controlled by `use_contextual` parameter, not as separate paths

2. **Quick Start** - Added actual working commands:
   - Start retrieval pipeline server first
   - Index documents with `index_local_laws_contextual.py`
   - Run queries with `main.py`

3. **Terminology** - Changed "non-contextual" to "standard" throughout to be clearer

4. **Code Examples** - Updated with actual classes and configuration from the implementation

5. **Logging Examples** - Changed to show real log output format

6. **Table Formatting** - Fixed Markdown tables for proper rendering

The README now accurately describes that the system has a single implementation that can operate in either contextual or standard mode based on the `use_contextual` flag, rather than having two completely separate paths. This matches the actual codebase where the same chunking and retrieval components are used, just with context generation optionally enabled.

### 👤 You

Also update the README for the agentic-rag project to accurately reflect the current code

---

### 🤖 Cursor Assistant

I'll update the README for the agentic-rag project to accurately reflect the current implementation. Let me first examine it and then make the necessary corrections.

---

### 🤖 Cursor Assistant

I've successfully updated the agentic-rag project README to accurately reflect the current implementation. Here are the key corrections I made:

## Main Updates:

1. **Removed Non-Existent Features**:
   - Removed references to RAPTOR and GraphRAG backends (not actually implemented)
   - Removed test_structured_backends.py references (file exists but these backends aren't integrated)

2. **Corrected Usage Instructions**:
   - Added proper instructions for starting the retrieval pipeline first
   - Updated to use `index_local_laws.py` for indexing the included Chinese law documents
   - Fixed command-line arguments to match what's actually in main.py

3. **Updated Project Structure**:
   - Accurately listed the files that exist
   - Added the laws/ directory structure with Chinese legal documents
   - Removed references to files that don't exist

4. **Fixed Configuration**:
   - Listed actual environment variables used
   - Removed structured index configurations that aren't implemented
   - Added all supported LLM provider API keys

5. **Improved Examples**:
   - Used actual Chinese legal queries that match the indexed documents
   - Added proper examples for verbose/no-verbose modes
   - Showed real interactive mode commands

6. **Added Clear Explanations**:
   - Better explanation of how ReAct pattern works in the agent
   - Clearer distinction between agentic and non-agentic modes
   - Added troubleshooting for common issues

7. **Enhanced Formatting**:
   - Added emojis for better visual organization
   - Improved section headers and structure
   - Used proper markdown formatting

The README now provides accurate, actionable instructions that match the actual codebase and will help users successfully run the agentic RAG system.
