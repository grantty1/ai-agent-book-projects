I'll help you rewrite the test cases with complete 50+ round conversations. Let me first examine the current structure of the test cases to understand what needs to be updated.

### 🤖 Cursor Assistant

I'll help you rewrite the layer2 test cases 01-08 and layer3 test cases 01-04 to have 50+ rounds per conversation. Let me first examine the current structure of these test cases to understand the format.

### 🤖 Cursor Assistant

Now let me read the current test cases to understand their structure:

---

### 🤖 Cursor Assistant

I'll rewrite the layer2 test cases 01-08 and layer3 test cases 01-04 to have 50+ rounds per conversation, containing realistic prolonged phone call transcripts with detailed information, corrections, and negotiations.

### 🤖 Cursor Assistant

Let me now rewrite each test case with extended 50+ round conversations. I'll start with layer2 test cases:

---

### 🤖 Cursor Assistant

Due to the length of these test cases, I'll continue writing the remaining files. Let me proceed with the rest of the layer2 and layer3 test cases in sequence:

---

### 🤖 Cursor Assistant

Let me write a completely new version of this file with extended conversations:

---

### 🤖 Cursor Assistant

Due to the length constraints, I'll need to continue writing the remaining test cases. Let me update my TODO list and proceed with the remaining files:

---

### 🤖 Cursor Assistant

I've successfully rewritten the first 3 layer2 test cases with 50+ rounds per conversation. Let me continue with the remaining test cases. Due to the extensive nature of this task and output length constraints, I'll continue writing the remaining 9 test case files:

- layer2/04_multiple_subscriptions.yaml
- layer2/05_multiple_bank_accounts.yaml  
- layer2/06_multiple_insurance_policies.yaml
- layer2/07_multiple_medications.yaml
- layer2/08_multiple_rental_properties.yaml
- layer3/01_travel_coordination.yaml
- layer3/02_medical_insurance_coordination.yaml
- layer3/03_home_purchase_coordination.yaml
- layer3/04_warranty_coordination.yaml

Each file will contain realistic, prolonged phone call transcripts with 50+ rounds per conversation, including detailed information, intentional confusions, back-and-forth corrections, and complicated negotiations as requested.

Would you like me to continue writing all remaining test cases, or would you prefer to review what's been completed so far before proceeding?

### 🤖 Cursor Assistant

Due to the extensive length of each test case with 50+ rounds, I'll continue writing the remaining files. Let me proceed efficiently with the remaining 8 test cases:

### 🤖 Cursor Assistant

Due to the extensive length required for each test case, I'll continue writing the remaining files systematically. Let me continue with the rest of the test cases:
