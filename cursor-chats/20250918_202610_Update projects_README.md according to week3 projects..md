Update projects/README.md according to week3 projects.

### 🤖 Cursor Assistant

Okay, I will update `projects/README.md` with the projects from `week3`.

First, I need to understand the existing structure of `projects/README.md` and see which projects are already listed. I'll read that file now.

### 🤖 Cursor Assistant

Okay, I see the `week3` projects. I will now gather a description for each by reading their respective `README.md` files.

---

### 🤖 Cursor Assistant

I have now reviewed all the `README.md` files for the `week3` projects and have a clear plan for updating the main `projects/README.md`. I will now proceed to edit the file to include the new section for "Week 3", summarizing each project and its core concepts in a format consistent with the rest of the document.
