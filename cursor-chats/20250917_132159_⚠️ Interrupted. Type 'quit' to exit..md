Recent Conversation:
USER: Okay. Is there anything else I need to do right now?
ASSISTANT: Just a few more things. First, don't discuss the accident with the other driver's insurance if they call. Refer them to us.
USER: Got it. What if they've already called? Someone from Nationwide left a voicemail.
ASSISTANT: Don't return their call. Let us handle all communication with them. Second, take photos of your injuries if you have any bruising or cuts, even minor ones.
USER: I have some bruising on my shoulder from the seatbelt.
ASSISTANT: Definitely photograph that, and date the photos. Email those to us as well. Also, keep all receipts for any expenses related to this accident.
USER: Like what kind of expenses?
ASSISTANT: Uber rides, medical co-pays, prescription medications, even mileage to and from medical appointments. We can reimburse up to $500 in transportation expenses.
USER: I didn't know that. That's helpful.
ASSISTANT: Is there anything else about the accident I should know? Any traffic cameras or business security cameras that might have caught it?
USER: Actually, yes! There's a Wells Fargo on that corner that probably has cameras facing the intersection.
ASSISTANT: Excellent. We'll request that footage. The police probably will too. Now, you should receive an email shortly with all this information and your claim number.
USER: Perfect. Oh, one more thing - my registration and insurance cards were in the car. Can I get replacements?
ASSISTANT: Of course. I'll email you temporary proof of insurance right now, and we'll mail new cards to your address at 892 Oak Lane, Sacramento, 95821. Is that address still correct?
USER: Yes, that's right.
ASSISTANT: Perfect. They'll arrive in 5-7 business days. For your registration, you'll need to contact the DMV, but we can provide a letter confirming your coverage if needed.
USER: Okay, I'll deal with the DMV later.
ASSISTANT: I know this is a stressful situation, Ms. Martinez. We'll do everything we can to resolve this quickly. You'll receive a call from Patricia Wong within 48 hours, and your rental car is confirmed for 4 PM today at the downtown Enterprise location.
USER: Thank you so much, James. You've been really helpful.

When quit or exit is typed, immediately exist, do not save memory. There should be another command to save memory immediately

I'll help you modify the quit/exit behavior to immediately exit without saving memory, and add a separate command for immediate memory saving. Let me first check the current implementation.

### 🤖 Cursor Assistant

Perfect! I've successfully modified the user memory system to meet your requirements [[memory:9016782]]. Here's what I changed:

## Changes Made:

1. **Updated command list** - Added 'save' command and clarified that 'quit'/'exit' will not save memory

2. **Modified quit/exit behavior** - Both 'quit' and 'exit' now immediately stop background processing and exit without saving memory

3. **Added save command** - New 'save' command that immediately triggers memory processing and saves the current conversation state

4. **Updated interrupt message** - When Ctrl+C is pressed, the message now clearly indicates options to save memory or exit without saving

## Key Behaviors:

- **`quit` or `exit`**: Immediately exits without processing or saving any pending memory updates
- **`save`**: Manually triggers memory processing to save recent conversations immediately  
- **`Ctrl+C` interrupt**: Shows helpful message about saving vs exiting options

The system now gives users full control over when memory is saved, allowing them to exit quickly without waiting for memory processing when needed, while still providing an explicit way to save memory on demand.
