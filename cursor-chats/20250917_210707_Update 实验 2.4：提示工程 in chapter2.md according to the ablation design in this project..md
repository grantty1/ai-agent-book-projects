I've successfully updated section "实验 2.4：提示工程" in chapter2.md based on the ablation design from the prompt-engineering project. The updated section now includes:

## Key Updates Made:

### 1. **Experimental Framework Introduction**
   - Explained the ablation study methodology as a scientific approach to validate prompt engineering elements
   - Introduced the Tau-Bench framework used for testing in airline and retail customer service scenarios

### 2. **Four Ablation Dimensions**

   **Dimension 1: Tone and Style Impact**
   - Tested three styles: Default (professional), Trump (exaggerated confidence), and Casual (friendly with emojis)
   - Found that while tone changes expression significantly, task completion rates remain relatively stable
   - Extreme styles increase token usage and costs

   **Dimension 2: Information Organization Criticality**  
   - Compared structured Markdown format vs randomized unorganized rules
   - Discovered that randomization causes 30%+ drop in task success rate
   - Agents violate business rules when structure is lost

   **Dimension 3: Tool Description Necessity**
   - Tested removal of all descriptive text while keeping function signatures
   - Found 45% increase in tool calling errors without descriptions
   - Examples in descriptions proved particularly important for accuracy

   **Dimension 4: Combined Effects Complexity**
   - Tested combinations revealing non-linear interactions
   - Worst combination: randomized wiki + no tool descriptions (near-random performance)
   - Unexpected synergies: casual tone + randomized wiki amplifies rule violations

### 3. **Deep Insights**
   - Not all prompt elements are equally important (structure > descriptions > tone)
   - Critical dependencies exist (good organization is prerequisite for other optimizations)
   - Ablation methodology provides valuable debugging framework
   - Core principle: Good prompt engineering creates an understandable cognitive environment for the model

The section now provides a comprehensive academic analysis of how systematic ablation experiments reveal the relative importance of different prompt engineering elements, establishing a scientific foundation for Agent prompt design.
