“后训练成本高昂” 是站不住脚的，正确的 argument 是 "后训练不擅长记忆大量事实信息" 。据此，修改文中关于后训练的部分

Okay, I understand. The argument that post-training is expensive is incorrect. Instead, the focus should be on its weakness in memorizing large amounts of factual information. I will now make that correction in `book/chapter3.md`.

### 🤖 Cursor Assistant

Okay, I understand. The argument about post-training being expensive is weak, and the better argument is its inefficiency at memorizing large amounts of factual information. I will revise the relevant section in `book/chapter3.md` to reflect this.

I have reviewed the changes. It appears I made an error in the previous edit, modifying the wrong section and incorrectly reverting a change in the summary. I will now correct these mistakes. I will first re-read the file to ensure I have the latest version, then apply the correct edits to the initial definition of post-training and the summary conclusion.

### 🤖 Cursor Assistant

Okay, I understand. My previous edit was incorrect. I will now correct the text in `book/chapter3.md` according to your instructions.

### 🤖 Cursor Assistant

The requested modifications have been applied to `book/chapter3.md`. I have replaced the argument regarding the high cost of post-training with the more precise point that it is not adept at memorizing extensive factual information. The rest of the text has been adjusted to ensure consistency with this updated argument.
