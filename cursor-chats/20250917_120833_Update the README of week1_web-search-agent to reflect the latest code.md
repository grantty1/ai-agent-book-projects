### 🤖 Cursor Assistant

I have successfully updated the README for the week1/web-search-agent project to accurately reflect the current code implementation. The main updates include:

**Key improvements made:**

1. **Corrected the component descriptions** - Updated the agent.py section to list the actual methods present in the code (_chat, _get_system_prompt, _get_tools) instead of non-existent ones (think, _decompose_task).

2. **Added quickstart.py documentation** - Included the quick start script in both the usage instructions and component descriptions, highlighting its guided interactive experience feature.

3. **Enhanced technical details** - Specified the exact model version (kimi-k2-0905-preview), iteration limits (max 5), and temperature control for content generation.

4. **Expanded advanced features** - Detailed the specific methods in AdvancedWebSearchAgent class (batch_search, search_with_context, comparative_search, fact_check).

5. **Updated configuration options** - Added both MOONSHOT_API_KEY and KIMI_API_KEY for backward compatibility, and included the temperature parameter.

6. **Refined development roadmap** - Specified implementation details like using aiohttp for async operations and tenacity for retry mechanisms.

The README now provides an accurate and comprehensive overview of the web-search-agent project, properly documenting all existing functionality while maintaining clarity about the system's architecture and capabilities.
